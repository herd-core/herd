# Herd 🐄

**Herd** is a session-affine process pool for Go. It manages a fleet of OS subprocess "workers" and routes incoming requests to the correct worker based on an arbitrary session ID.

### The Core Invariant
**1 Session ID → 1 Worker**, for the lifetime of the session.

This invariant transforms stateful binaries (like Browsers, LLMs, or REPLs) into multi-tenant services. Because a session always hits the same process, you can maintain in-memory state, KV caches, or local file systems without a complex coordination layer.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Session Affinity**: Guaranteed routing of a session ID to its unique pinned worker.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamically scale workers between `min` and `max` bounds based on demand.
- **Idle Eviction (TTL)**: Automatically reclaim workers that haven't been accessed within a configurable TTL.
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous liveness checks on every worker process; dead workers are automatically replaced.
- **Singleflight Acquisition**: Protects against "thundering herd" issues where multiple concurrent requests for a new session ID try to spawn workers simultaneously.
- **Generic Clients**: Fully generic `Pool[C]` supports any client type (HTTP, gRPC, custom structs).
- **Reverse Proxy Helper**: Built-in HTTP reverse proxy that handles the full session lifecycle (Acquire → Proxy → Release).

## 🛠️ Quick Start: Ollama Multi-Agent Gateway

Here is an example of turning `ollama serve` into a multi-tenant LLM gateway where each agent (or user) gets their own dedicated Ollama process. This is specifically useful for isolating context windows or KV caches per agent without downloading models multiple times.

You can find the full, runnable code for this example in [`examples/ollama/main.go`](examples/ollama/main.go).

### 1. The Code

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"time"

	"github.com/hackstrix/herd"
	"github.com/hackstrix/herd/proxy"
)

func main() {
	// 1. Define how to spawn an Ollama worker on a dynamic port
	factory := herd.NewProcessFactory("ollama", "serve").
		WithEnv("OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:{{.Port}}").
		WithHealthPath("/")

	// 2. Create the pool with auto-scaling and TTL eviction
	pool, _ := herd.New(factory,
		herd.WithAutoScale(1, 10),
		herd.WithTTL(10 * time.Minute),
	)

	// 3. Setup a session-aware reverse proxy
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.Handle("/api/", proxy.NewReverseProxy(pool, func(r *http.Request) string {
		return r.Header.Get("X-Agent-ID") // Pin worker by X-Agent-ID header
	}))

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux))
}
```

### 2. Running It

Start the gateway (assuming you are in the `examples/ollama` directory):

```bash
go run . --port 8080 --min 1 --max 5
```

### 3. Usage

Send requests with an `X-Agent-ID` header. Herd guarantees that all requests with the same ID will hit the exact same underlying `ollama serve` instance!

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat \
  -H "X-Agent-ID: agent-42" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama3",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello! I am agent 42."}]
  }'
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Herd is built around three core interfaces:

- **`Worker[C]`**: Represents a single running subprocess. It provides the typed client `C` used to communicate with the process.
- **`WorkerFactory[C]`**: Responsible for spawning new `Worker` instances. The default `ProcessFactory` handles local OS binaries.
- **`Pool[C]`**: The central router. It maps session IDs to workers, manages the horizontal scaling, and handles session lifecycle.

### Session Lifecycle
1. **`Acquire(ctx, sessionID)`**: Retrieves the worker pinned to the ID. If none exists, a free worker is popped from the pool (or a new one is spawned).
2. **`Session.Worker.Client()`**: Use the returned worker to perform your logic.
3. **`Session.Release()`**: Returns the worker to the pool. The bond to the session ID is preserved until the TTL expires or the worker crashes.
